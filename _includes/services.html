                    <p class="text-muted text-justify small">Multiprizer uses the most sophisticated Provable Random
                        Number currently known, to generate winner - Ledger based random of Oraclize, with on-chain
                        proof verification. This creates purest 'random' to select winners from the strategic lot.

                    <h4>Highest Level of Decentralization for robust and tamper-proof Gameplay</h4>
                    <p class="text-muted text-justify small">This DApp is built with game parameters such as DirectPlay
                        and a fixed significant house edge, which make sure that the game cannot be controlled or
                        manipulated by any party – neither malicious players, nor rogue miners, not even the admin or
                        creator of this game. <a href="https://docs.multiprizer.io/decentralization">Read More</a></p>

                    <p class="text-muted text-justify small">The game tokens, once purchased, can be undone by the
                        ‘revert’ feature in which all the player's purchased tokens are cancelled, and the token value
                        refunded to the player. This is applicable at any point in time as long as the timer for that
                        round has not expired.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted text-justify small">Players don’t even have to visit the DApp site to play. One
                        can send a token value multiple of a specific game, from their Ethereum Wallet to the Contract
                        Address, and the player participation gets auto-confirmed. <a

                    <h4>Emphasis on Strategy rather than ‘Random’ based outcome</h4>
                    <p class="text-muted text-justify small">Games are designed such that there is a lot of leverage on
                        how you play, rather than dependence on chance, to maximizes your outcome of victory. The per
                        token win probability itself is extremely high, teamed with option to purchase and revert at
                        will, brings strategy as key to victory. <a

                    <p class="text-muted text-justify small">The Smart Contract follows best-in-class secure methodology
                        derived from various top safety standards such as Consensys, OpenZeppelin etc. which prevents
                        attacks such as re-entrancy, overflow/underflow etc. The contract is also publicly verified,
                        providing
                        full transparency of game algorithm. <a href="https://docs.multiprizer.io/security">Read

                        draw for participants who have played any Game Board at least once, without reverting. The winner is
                        again chosen using provable random like game rounds & MegaPrize amount automatically credited. <a

                    <p class="text-muted text-justify small">The games cannot be obstructed in any manner while the
                        round is still on. The game locks can only be implemented by admin on completion of game rounds,
                        so does contract kill. Also, to maintain consistent win probability, new game boards are added instead
                        of increasing total tokens for a specific game. </p>
